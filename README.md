# Small Office Network Design Project

This repository contains the design, configuration, and documentation for a small office network, developed as part of a four-week project. The network was designed and implemented using **Cisco Packet Tracer** and includes features such as VLANs, inter-VLAN routing, DHCP, and IP phone configurations.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a reliable and scalable small office network. It covers all phases of the network lifecycle, including planning, device configuration, testing, and final documentation.

### Key Features
- **VLAN Configuration**: Segregation of devices into management, sales, and IT VLANs.
- **Inter-VLAN Routing**: Enabled communication between VLANs using a Layer 3 switch.
- **DHCP**: Dynamic IP addressing implemented directly on the router.
- **IP Phone Setup**: Integrated voice traffic on a separate VLAN.
- **Scalability**: Designed for future expansion with clear segmentation and trunking.

## Network Topology

The network includes:
1. A router connected to the internet.
2. A Layer 3 core switch.
3. Two Layer 2 access switches connected to various devices:
   - **AS1**: 4 IP phones, 2 printers, and 1 PC.
   - **AS2**: 1 IP phone, 5 PCs, and 1 printer.
